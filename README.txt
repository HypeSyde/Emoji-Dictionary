This swift powered iphone application was used to learn the basics of swift and create objects

USAGE:
  The app was used to practice making objects for each emoji at the iphone disposable and give each emoji a attached description of what was my personal meaning of that
  emoji's use.
  
HOW TO USE
  after copying the git source code to your xcode software, you need to then install swift language in the xcode terminal and run version 3.
  
  then the app can be installed to a connected iphone via a cord.
